# Prework study guide Webpage

## Description

To learn the basics of what is required to be prepared for the upcoming bootcamp. 
The idea of learning a new exciting career full of challenges would be the motivating factor for me. It solves the idea that anyone is able to learn how to become a 'Front end developer' and that it is for anyone who is willing to put it in the effort. During this prework ive learned some basic commands on github, how to create, edit, push & repositories, basics of some HTML & CSS building. I would say i require some time read more material on javascript to further increase my understanding on the topic.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
